# spider-chase

Project developed for the course of Robotics.  
There were builded and programmed two spider-shaped robots, capable of moving as a result of received command through http.  
The two robots have the same capabilites but different goals.  
Escaper: Receive commands from a joystick or a android phone  
Chaser:  Receive commands from a Computer Vision algorithm written in OpenCV, which recognize the position of the fugitive spider and send
the commands for following it.   
  
For the control of the robots STM32 F401 Nucleo has been used together with:  
-L9110s Motor Driver  
-Arduino development shield  
-ESP8266 WiFi module
